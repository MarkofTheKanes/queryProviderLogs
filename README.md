This script queries a csv formatted log file from a cloud provider and returns the count and percentage of total of the log severity types - ERROR, WARNING, INFO and no-severity. It also outputs log entries with no defined severity to a separate file for future analysis.
It is intended to be used to determine how much space a client can save by refining the logs they store.
