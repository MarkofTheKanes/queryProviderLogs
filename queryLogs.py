Script: queryLogs.py
v1 - 15/3/24
Author: Mark O'Kane
Purpose: Query a csv formatted log file from a cloud provider and return the count and percentage of total of the log severity types - ERROR, WARNING, INFO and no-severity
TO DO:
- check required modules are installed. if not, install them automatically
- write a wrapper to call this for >1 csv log files to be analysed
- perform analysis of NO SEVERITY log entries
